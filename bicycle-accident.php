                      <h4>Car Accidents</h4>
                      <p>Drivers have a duty to obey the rules of the road and pay attention to their surroundings. When drivers neglect these responsibilities, they can injure or even kill other motorists. If you or a loved one have been injured in an auto accident, you may be entitled to compensation from the at-fault driver’s insurance company.  </p>
                      <p>In the aftermath of an auto accident, you may be left dealing with physical pain, doctor appointments, medical bills, car repairs, missed time from work, or funeral expenses. Unfortunately, insurance companies are not in the business of acting with your best interest in mind. Their goal is to settle your claim as quickly and cheaply as possible. That’s why it is important to hire an experienced south Florida car accident lawyer who will fight to get you the compensation you deserve. </p>
                      <p>At the Law Offices of David A. Salmon, a south Florida car accident law firm, we have the experience and resources to:</p>
                      <ul>

                      <h4>Motorcycle Accidents</h4>
                      <p>From hazardous road conditions to heavily traveled roadways, Florida is one of the most dangerous states for motorcycle riders. Motorcycle accidents tend to cause severe injuries because motorcyclists often have very little protection.</p>
                      <p>Insurance claims involving motorcycle accidents can be complicated; there are circumstances that can affect your ability to receive compensation. If you or a loved one have been seriously injured in a motorcycle accident caused by a negligent driver, you should contact a south Florida motorcycle accident attorney to help you negotiate a fair settlement.</p>

                      <h4>Truck Accidents</h4>
                      <p>Trucks are large, heavy vehicles that can cause serious injuries to other drivers on the road. Florida remains one of the top contributors to injuries and fatalities caused by accidents involving trucks due to its high volume of traffic. Common causes of trucking accidents are speeding, distracted driving, fatigue and driving while under the influence. </p>
                      <p>When a trucking accident occurs, police and insurance adjusters perform a detailed investigation to determine who is at fault, as there may be multiple defendants and more than one layer of insurance coverage available.</p>

                      <h4>Bicycle Accidents</h4>
                      <p>Florida is one of the most dangerous states for bicycle accidents. Unfortunately, an increased number of cyclists on the road results in an increased number of bicycle accidents. While cyclists must take care in riding their bicycles on the road, negligence on the part of motor vehicle drivers is said to be the main cause of most bicycle accidents. However, even if you are partially at fault for your own bicycle accident, it is important to remember that Florida operates under the pure comparative fault system, which means you may still be entitled to compensation from the at-fault driver’s insurance company.  </p>

                      <p>According to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the number of school bus accidents is on the rise. Higher population and increased student enrollment lead to more school busses being on the road. Public transportation/private charter bus accidents are also not uncommon. Injuries from any type of bus accident can be severe because these vehicles are large, heavy, and often do not come equipped with seatbelts. Determining who is at fault can require an in-depth investigation; there can be multiple defendants involved and several layers of insurance coverage.</p>

If you or a loved one have been injured as a pedestrian, it is important to remember that Florida operates under the pure comparative fault system, which means you may still be entitled to compensation even if you are partially at fault for the accident. </p>
